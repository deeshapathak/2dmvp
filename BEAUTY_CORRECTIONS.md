# Beauty Corrections & Enhancements

## Current Beauty Maximization Features

This document lists **all** cosmetic corrections and enhancements that the AI applies to maximize facial beauty and harmony.

### 1. **Facial Symmetry Correction** ✅
- **What it does**: Balances left/right facial features using localized warping
- **When applied**: When symmetry score < 0.9 (target symmetry)
- **How**: Subtle mirroring and blending of facial center region
- **Maximum adjustment**: 15% symmetry improvement
- **Disclosed in recommendations**: Yes ✅

### 2. **Comprehensive Rhinoplasty** ✅
- **What it does**: Reduces nasal width for more elegant proportions
- **When applied**: When nose-to-IPD ratio > 0.75 (ideal ratio)
- **Components**:
  - **Main width reduction**: Up to 30% nasal width narrowing
  - **Tip refinement**: Additional 15% tip narrowing (if reduction > 15%)
  - **Bridge refinement**: Additional 10% bridge narrowing (if reduction > 12%)
- **How**: Sophisticated perspective warping with tapered nose shape
- **Maximum adjustment**: 30% width reduction + tip/bridge refinements
- **Disclosed in recommendations**: Yes ✅ (all components listed)

### 3. **Jawline Contouring** ✅
- **What it does**: Corrects jaw asymmetry by shifting one side toward center
- **When applied**: When jaw asymmetry > 1mm
- **How**: Localized perspective transformation of jaw region
- **Maximum adjustment**: 2.0mm lateral correction
- **Disclosed in recommendations**: Yes ✅ (includes mm measurement)

### 4. **Chin Enhancement** ✅
- **What it does**: Increases chin projection for better profile definition
- **When applied**: When chin projection < 20 (threshold)
- **How**: Localized forward warping/stretching of chin region
- **Maximum adjustment**: 15% forward projection increase
- **Disclosed in recommendations**: Yes ✅ (includes percentage)

### 5. **Facial Thirds Optimization** ⚠️
- **What it does**: Adjusts upper/middle/lower facial third proportions
- **When applied**: When deviation from ideal (33%/33%/34%) > 5%
- **How**: Currently a placeholder (returns original image)
- **Visualization**: Not yet implemented
- **Disclosed in recommendations**: Yes ✅ (with note that visualization not implemented)

## Beauty Standards Used

### Symmetry Target
- **Target**: 0.9 (90% symmetry)
- **Ideal**: Perfect left/right balance

### Nose Proportions
- **Ideal nose-to-IPD ratio**: 0.75
- **Maximum reduction**: 30% of nose width
- **Additional refinements**: Tip (15%) and bridge (10%)

### Jaw Asymmetry
- **Tolerance**: Up to 1mm (no correction needed)
- **Maximum correction**: 2.0mm lateral adjustment

### Chin Projection
- **Threshold**: < 20 triggers enhancement
- **Enhancement amount**: 15% forward projection

### Facial Thirds
- **Upper third**: Ideal 33%
- **Middle third**: Ideal 33%
- **Lower third**: Ideal 34%
- **Tolerance**: ±5%
